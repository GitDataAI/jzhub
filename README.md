## JZLab include but not limited to：

1. Visualize and interact with JZFS repositories
2. Visualize and interact JZFlow pipelines and Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).
3. One-click to start the fully functional JupyterLab environment.
4. Examine the performance of versioned/registered models.
5. Monitor the status of model services including health and resource usage stats, and view deployment history and related logs.
6. Easily upload and manage datasets and shared resources.
7. Browse and share files with other group members in a collaborative, group-centric, environment.

9. The easiest way to do the infrastructure orchestration for setting up 10+ different tools to build your infrastructure.


## How different roles use JZLab
- Data Scientist
    - Data scientists can stay informed and focused on training and running their models.
    - In the past, there was a lot of manual work of setting the environment, which is a fragmented and time consuming analysis process. And it is hard to collaborate with a team on the same project.
    - Now, you can carry out data analytics and optimizations with ML easily, and contribute your time on what really matters.
- IT Leader
    - Gives IT leaders flexibility and administration authority to configure resources.
    - In the past, it’s hard to keep track of each teams' needs and environment settings. Also, the hardware, resources, and GPU usage are unsure.
    - Now, You can equip and enable data teams with the tools and resources they need as easy as pie. And easily deploy the model within an hour.
